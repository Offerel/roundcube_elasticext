# Roundcube Elastic Ext Plugin
This plugin makes some simple tweaks for the Roundcube elastic skin. For example it moves the send button from the bottom of the compose window to the top right side of the main toolbar. Optionaly, you can also tweak the loginscreen a little bit to make it not that bring. This plugins works only with elastic skin. If you use another skin, the plugin should have no effect.

# Issues
Please create issues in the [Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/Offerel/roundcube_elasticext/issues) issue tracker. I have disabled the issue tracker in GitHub.com because the repo there is only used as a workaround and for compatibility reasons.
